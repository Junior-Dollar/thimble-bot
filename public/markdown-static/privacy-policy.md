# Privacy Policy

Thimble Bot is a Discord bot aimed to bring useful and fun commands to Discord server members and moderators. Our website is available at https://bot.thimble.cx and is deployed on [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) servers. The bot application runs on a [Hetzner Virtual Private Server](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). This document describes when, how, and what kind of data Thimble Bot collects about you.

## Website

The website does not collect any personal information about you and does not place cookies on your computer. It's a static website that only communicates with GitHub's servers. Please read [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) and [Netlify's Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

## Logging

### Per-Message Logging

Every time you send a command in a public server, Thimble Bot will send a message to a designated channel in a private server. This information contains:

  - The ID of the Discord server (guild) the command was sent in
  - The ID of the Discord channel the command was sent in
  - The full message of the command
  - The ID of the message's author

The commands you execute in direct messages and group chats will **NEVER** send any logs to the owner.

The owner uses the abovementioned information in order to take the necessary measures in case of misuse/abuse of the bot application.

### Error Reporting

Thimble Bot will send error reports using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) in case of unhandled exceptions. The information sent will be specific to the code (i.e. the exact location of the errored code) and does not contain any personal details.

## Changes

We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy at any given moment without notification. The up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy will always be available at https://bot.thimble.cx/privacy.

## Consent

By using the services offered by Thimble Bot, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.
